# 📘 C++ Keywords (C++17)

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Keywords** are predefined words that have special meanings to the compiler. For example,

```cpp
int money;
```

Here, `int` is a keyword that indicates `money` is a variable of type integer.

## ⚠️ Important Note

> 🧠 **Note:** As C++ is a case sensitive language, all keywords must be written in lowercase.

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

- 🚫 Keywords **cannot be used as variable names**
- 📌 They form the **core syntax of the C++ language**
- 🧩 Essential for writing correct and efficient programs

---

## 🏁 📢 Summary

✨ C++ keywords:

- 🔑 Define the structure and behavior of programs  
- ⚙️ Are reserved by the compiler  
- 📘 Must be used correctly to avoid errors  

---

💡 *Mastering keywords is the first step toward becoming proficient in C++ programming!*

# 📘 Variables in C++ 


## 📌 🧠 Definition and Purpose

A variable is defined as an identifier used to identify and store input data in a program
. In the OOP paradigm, which includes C++, programs are organized around objects that contain data (stored in variables) and the functions that operate on that data
.

---

## 🧾 🔤 Variable Naming Rules


* 🔡 **Case Sensitivity:** Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `money` and `Money` are distinct)
  .
* 🔤 **Characters:** Names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`) *(C++ does not typically use `$`)*
  .
* 🔢 **Numbers:** After the first character, variable names can include digits (0-9)
  .
* 🚫 **Exclusions:** No spaces are allowed, and no special symbols are permitted in the middle of a name except for the underscore
  .
* ⚠️ **Reserved Words:** Variables cannot be named after keywords (reserved words with predefined meanings)
  .
* 🧮 **Assignment:** In the syntax of an assignment statement, the variable name must always exist on the left-hand side of the assignment operator (e.g., `variable_name = value;`)
  .

## 🧩 📊 Types of Variables and Scope

In C++ variables categorize into three primary types based on their location and behavior, which are fundamental concepts in C++:

| 🏷️ Variable Type         | 📖 Definition and Scope                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 **Local Variables**    | Declared inside a method, block, or constructor. They exist only during the execution of that block and are not accessible outside of it                            |
| 🔹 **Instance Variables** | Declared inside a class but outside of methods. Each object (instance) of a class has its own unique copy of these variables                                        |
| 🔹 **Static Variables**   | Also known as class variables, these are declared with the `static` keyword. They are shared among all objects of the class, meaning only one copy exists in memory |

---

## 💻 ⚙️ Characteristics Variables 

A few specific characteristics regarding the environment in which C++ variables operate:

* ⚡ **Compiled Performance:** C++ is a compiled language, which makes the execution and handling of its variables generally faster than interpreted languages like Java
  .

* 🧠 **Dependency:** C++ is treated as architecturally dependent and non-portable, meaning variable sizes and behaviors may be tied to specific processor architectures
  .

* 🗂 **Memory Management:** Unlike Java, which uses an automatic Garbage Collector to reclaim memory from unused objects and variables, C++ is noted as being different in its approach to memory management
  .

---

## 🏁 📢 Summary

✨ Variables in C++:

* 📦 Store data used in programs
* 🧩 Form the foundation of objects in OOP
* 🔐 Follow strict naming and scope rules
* ⚡ Offer high performance with manual memory control



# 📘 Data Types in C++ 

---

## 🌟 Overview

 In C++ data types categorize  into three main groups :

---

## 🧩 🔑 Categories of Data Types

### 🔹 1. Fundamental (Primitive)

These are the most basic types that store a single value, such as integers or characters
. In C++, these are often architecturally dependent, meaning their exact size can vary based on the processor
.

---

### 🔹 2. Derived

These types allow for the storage of multiple values of the same type, such as arrays
.

---

### 🔹 3. User-Defined

This category involves variables that can hold multiple values of dissimilar types, primarily achieved through classes and objects

| 🏷️ Type             | 📦 Bytes | 📈 Range                  |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| `char`               | 1        | -128 to 127               |
| `unsigned char`      | 1        | 0 to 255                  |
| `signed char`        | 1        | -128 to 127               |

## 🧠 🔐 Data Abstraction and C++

Several principles regarding how data is handled in C++:

* 🎯 **Data Abstraction:** This is the process of hiding the underlying characteristics or internal structure of a data entity from the user
  . It allows programmers to work with complex objects without needing to understand how the data is stored internally
  .

* 🧱 **User-Defined Types via Classes:** In the OOP paradigm used by C++, a class serves as a blueprint or template to describe the properties (data types) of a specific type of object
  .

* 🔒 **Data Hiding:** C++ is noted as being more secure than older procedural languages because it provides a proper way to implement data hiding through encapsulation
  .


## 🏁 📢 Summary

✨ In C++, data types:

* 📦 Define the kind of data a variable can store
* 🧩 Support both simple and complex data structures
* 🔐 Enable abstraction and data hiding through OOP
* ⚡ Provide high performance with system-level control

---

💡 *Understanding data types is essential for writing efficient and optimized C++ programs!*
